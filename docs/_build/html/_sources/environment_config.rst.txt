Environment File
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Environment files use the INI format and contain the configuration of
the machine on which Sencast runs.

You should create your own environment file for every machine you install Sencast on.

The file should be placed in the environments folder and name "your computer name".ini if for some reason this is not
possible you should pass the location of your environment file to the sencast main function.

The following example environment file should be adaptable for any use cases.
